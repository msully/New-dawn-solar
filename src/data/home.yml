    Without the sun, life as we know would not exist. The light and heat
    radiated by the solar source sustains plant and animal life on earth,
    providing the fuel for all of the planet’s natural processes.


    Most of the earth’s surface receives enough sunlight making it viable to use
    solar energy. In fact, each hour of sunlight that reaches the earth contains
    potential energy greater than the amount of electricity used annually by
    every person on the planet.


    Harnessing solar power will be important for our energy future, providing
    energy diversity and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels which pollute
    the environment.


    Opting for solar Energy is not only financially rewarding but also enables
    you to make a great contribution to avoid fossil fuel and making our world a
    better place for today and generations to come. This allows our next
    generation to be able to experience living in a world that we, the older
    generation, lived in harmony years ago.

        Under South African Tax Legislation a Taxpayer who is bringing in a
        Solar scheme plant and equipment for the first time by that Taxpayer for
        the purpose of his/ her trade may deduct the full cost against taxable
        income in the year its incurred. Deemed at 28 % but each client will be
        advised by his Consultants in this regard.

    Considered a promising energy source for decades, solar panels can be found
    on everything from rooftops and roadside signs to stadiums and spacecrafts.
    Solar energy works by taking energy from the sun and changing it into
    electricity for homes and businesses.


    Once solar panels are installed on your roof and begin to create energy,
    there are a few steps required to turn it into energy your home or business
    can use. As the sun hits the solar panels, they generate direct current (DC)
    electricity, where the electrons flow around a circuit in one direction. In
    order for your home to use this energy, it must be converted from DC
    electricity to alternating current (AC) electricity, where the electrons are
    pushed and pulled.


    When you have solar panels installed on your home, you will also have a
    solar inverter installed. The solar inverter changes the DC output of the
    solar panels into AC electricity that your home can use.
