  Recent events in the World have provided a stark reminder to people everywhere
  that we depend on this Planet and the Cosmos for our sustenance and
  well-being.

  At **Newdawn Solar**, we believe the vast majority of people who own a
  property are now a potential **Solar Energy customer** primarily perhaps for
  its Environmental appeal but in South Africa for the other reasons as well in
  securing **Energy independence**, **investment** potential and **cost**
  clarity.

    Without the sun, life as we know would not exist. The light and heat
    radiated by the solar source sustains plant and animal life on earth,
    providing the fuel for all of the planet’s natural processes.


    Most of the earth’s surface receives enough sunlight making it viable to use
    solar energy. In fact, each hour of sunlight that reaches the earth contains
    potential energy greater than the amount of electricity used annually by
    every person on the planet.


    Harnessing solar power will be important for our energy future, providing
    energy diversity and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels which pollute
    the environment.


    Opting for solar Energy is not only financially rewarding but also enables
    you to make a great contribution to avoid fossil fuel and making our world a
    better place for today and generations to come. This allows our next
    generation to be able to experience living in a world that we, the older
    generation, lived in harmony years ago.

        Under SA Tax Legislation a taxpayer installing a solar scheme may claim
        a tax deduction for the cost of that installation in the year it's
        installed. This is a specific benefit derived from installing a solar
        scheme and a client should obtain the advice of a Professional
        Consultant to determine how best to take advantage of this significant
        benefit.

    Considered a promising energy source for decades, solar panels can be found
    on everything from rooftops and roadside signs to stadiums and spacecrafts.
    Solar energy works by taking energy from the sun and changing it into
    electricity for homes and businesses.


    Once solar panels are installed on your roof and begin to create energy,
    there are a few steps required to turn it into energy your home or business
    can use. As the sun hits the solar panels, they generate direct current (DC)
    electricity, where the electrons flow around a circuit in one direction. In
    order for your home to use this energy, it must be converted from DC
    electricity to alternating current (AC) electricity, where the electrons are
    pushed and pulled.


    When you have solar panels installed on your home, you will also have a
    solar inverter installed. The solar inverter changes the DC output of the
    solar panels into AC electricity that your home can use.
