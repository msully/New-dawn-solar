  New Dawn Solar provide a turnkey supply, installation and maintenance service
  for agricultural solar panels and offer a range of finance options.


  With the cost of electricity increasing year on year, many farms are looking
  to install solar panels in order to reduce their energy bills and maintain
  profitability.


  With vast roofs and expanses of unused land, farms are ideal locations for
  large solar PV systems that can offset high daily electricity consumption and
  help protect your business against future rises in electricity costs. The huge
  uptake in solar panels within the agriculture sector speaks volumes and is a
  true testament to the reliability and strong returns offered.
