New DawnSolar Energy (Pty)Lrdis set up as an Energy Developeri n response to the need for a specialist role like this and based on the complementary skills of the company management. In our Company we have:

* **Ian Pardy** as Technical Director with many years of experience in Energy evaluation, planning , sizing and project managing Energy schemes
* **Rennie Anderson** a Lawyer as Commercial Director with extensive commercial experience in property , staff evaluation & management
* **Harvey Anderson** an Economist and ex farmer as Director responsible for growing the business in the farming & Agricultural processing sectors. 

The Solar industry is set up with Specialist Contractors who design, procure, install and commission solar schemes. These companies are known as Solar EPC’s and we as Developers interface between the client and EPC to help in planning of the schemes, advising on options, conducting pre scheme energy evaluations / auditing, sizing to best effect, assessing feasibilities, advising on financing(where required), tax planning, selecting and appointing the Solar EPC, ensuring HSE compliance and that the EPC installs and commissions the project in terms of the contract.

Solar Energy is a relatively new concept formost Property owners and the Development function we provide is to give the owner surety and advice that they are getting value in the solution provided and are getting a scheme that is properly designed and functional for the purpose required. 

It’s also a highly technical process and Electricity by its nature is dangerous and careful planning and design is required on all schemes which is what we as Developers ensure in selecting the right Contractors both technically and price wise.

Most property owners want to own their Solar schemes and to secure the full commercial benefit provided by a typical solar project but there are others who choose to benefit from the clean & consistent power from solar but who are unwilling or unable to fund the capital cost of the solar scheme. Our Developer role extends, in these situations, to arranging third party owners who are prepared to own the scheme and lease it back. Or alternatively, the property owner may choose to lease the scheme himself with the view to taking ownership when the scheme is paid off.
