## Meet the company

New Dawn Solar is a new business with former shareholders of a nationally linked Solar business who have decided to invest into their own focussed Solar business. Harvey and Rennie Anderson have with Ian Pardy, created New Dawn and they are together growing the local entity.

The Directors are all experienced in this sector with the Andersons having 4 year’s experience and Pardy, strong technically, and having been around the Industry for a number of years. As is suggested, the business is built on the experience and knowledge of these individuals in access to markets, technical competence and as well as strong legal and commercial competence.

* **Energy Auditing and Energy Efficiency Planning/Solutions.** We are very skilled in this area and the first step in most projects is to meter the existing supply and assess Municipal or other Bills. Through this interaction the billing is corrected with tariff correction, lighting interventions, timing control on certain Appliances and the like.
* **Energy Solutions.** Through the use of Solar power we are able to design, install & commission solar schemes based on the correct sizing of the installation and where the client can benefit from such intervention. Not all Solar schemes stack up particularly in low or heavily subsidized Tariff scenarios though it’s fair to say that in the modern South African environment ,with increasing tariffs, just about all schemes are beneficial.

### **So, why convert to Solar?**

More and more South Africans from all walks of life and circumstances are asking how Solar and other interventions like Wind can benefit them? This is in fact a world - wide trend and it’s suggested that by 2050 as much as 50% of the Worlds power will be harnessed from using the sun and wind! From a Solar intervention point of view our business is focussed on two general areas in the property industry being :

**Residential Homes :**\
Individually owned homes where there is adequate roof space and an Energy bill with a high tariff (as most are), a solar scheme is possible and large homes where there are lots of appliances, with ducted Aircon, under floor heating etc , a solar scheme works very well. In the event of having a bonded property, the banks are very keen to finance Solar schemes, either by extending a bond or creating one, which allows for the scheme to be paid for over time.

**Residential Estates :**\
Developers of residential estates are increasingly using Solar as a substitute power supply and this introduces the added benefit of solar to a Landlord which will be dealt with below. Suffice it to note that Property Developers in both residential & commercial property can employ solar energy as another income stream either to subsidize tenants or profit by saving on the cost of electrical power. In general solar power is seen as a good option in a residential setting as the house is occupied 7 days / week. Although with large early morning or night time draw on power, storage through batteries is generally required and recommended.

**Commercial :**\
Commercial properties are our main target areas for solar installation. Most Commercial buildings operate during daylight hours with others being 7 days a week and at night.

**Commercial Property Types :**​

* **Retail –** being 7 days in operation and mainly in the day time, shopping centre Solar installations work well for Landlords.
* **Factories –**depending on the power draw (highly variable) factories with large roofs are great solar options. Warehouses with large roofs hold less appeal unless, for some reason, they draw substantial power, as some of course do, particularly where refrigeration and air conditioning is used.
* **Hospitals / Clinics –** as 7 day week operations and big Energy users Hospitals are great for solar and in our former business we installed solar on two Hospitals, both significant projects.
* **Hotels / Lodges** – also 7 days / week and with day time energy demand, these type of facilities are also well suited to solar energy installations.
* **Agro Processing facilities –** these are good where they operate 12 months of the year.

### **Other Considerations :**

A solar installation is a technical intervention on a property and consequently requires careful thought and planning with issues of financing, return on investment, payback being foremost in most large user’s minds. In most residential schemes it’s the utility of the solar and the desire most people have to get free of Government and Municipal control, that’s the principal driver. Infrastructure degradation is of major concern and we can expect major extended breakdowns. In our role as Energy Developers we use Ian as our internal Technical expert. We also use Dave Offerman, Ian experienced Engineer, in formulating strategy and we expect him to play an important role in our company.

​Solar schemes need to be funded either by clients using their own resources or with borrowed money and Banks together with other lenders are increasingly looking at lending into this sector.

Furthermore in a situation where the Solar PV client is a taxpayer who installs the solar in the course of his trade or business, he can write off 100% of his costs of equipment

and installation in the first year against his taxable income. A typical solar proposal contains the technical information concerning the solar scheme. Suffice it to note here that the Solar panels & Inverters carry long performance warranties which will extend long beyond the pay back period on the scheme. All these details are dealt with in our proposals, but we only install best quality products.

It is a fact that there are a number of operators presenting themselves as Solar experts out there. We are conscious of this and endeavour to present our clients with a credible and professional solution which really adds value. We believe the use of Solar Energy presents clients with the opportunity to take control of an important aspect of their business which has previously been the domain of the once dependable Power Utility. It’s become evident that Utility/Municipal supply can no longer be guaranteed and where there is supply, it’s becoming increasingly expensive, unreliable and with Infrastructure degradation . Environmental & sustainability issues apart, alternative Energy from Solar represents the smart choice for the discerning client who is looking both to secure his / her power supply into the future and, most importantly, limiting the cost of that by investing in a Solar scheme now.
